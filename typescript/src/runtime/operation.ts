/**
 * How a write operation proves its effect: it reads the confirmation the site shows, or reads back
 * the saved state, and records it: a Kernel script with `verified()` and no argument, declaring
 * `readback`, an HTTP implementation with `journal.confirmed`. `message` stays accepted for
 * revisions published before Kernel scripts stopped declaring it. `unverifiable` is for a site
 * that offers neither; its runs report the write as possibly completed.
 *
 * `commits` names the write's commit steps in order, such as `["save-address", "place-order"]`:
 * every step that can change the site (an autosave, a saved form step, the final submit). Each is
 * marked just before it dispatches: a Kernel script calls `enteringCommit(name)` right before the
 * execute call that sends it, an HTTP implementation `journal.enteringCommit(name)`. The host
 * treats a run as having sent nothing only when no mark was entered, and maintenance finishes
 * only the steps a failed run never reached.
 *
 * `commitsUnproven` names commit steps of `commits` after the last one the build's write session
 * entered, which the session never reached, as when the caller's facts ran out before them, such
 * as `["place-order"]` after a session that saved the address. Publication accepts them unentered
 * only after a step the session entered, and reports them as unproven until a run reaches them.
 * Runs ignore it.
